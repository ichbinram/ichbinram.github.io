Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I'm Ramprasad Raghunath, a dedicated researcher and engineer specializing in computational sciences and machine learning. I hold a Master of Science in Computational Sciences in Engineering from Technische UniversitÃ¤t Braunschweig and a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from Malnad College of Engineering.

Currently, I serve as a Research Associate at the Institute of Communication Technology in Technical University of Braunschweig, where I focus on developing machine learning solutions to optimize power control in cell-free massive MIMO systems.

Proficient in Python, Matlab, Docker and Rust, I utilize my skills in reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve complex engineering challenges. I am passionate about learning and often engage in personal projects such as game development and content creation using DaVinci Resolve.

Fluent in English, German, Hindi, and Kannada, I am enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects and advancing the field of computational and communication engineering. Thank you for visiting my site!
